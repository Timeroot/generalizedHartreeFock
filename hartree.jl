###
# The routine runs a Hartree-Fock calculation.
# It's taking as "input" the background Hamiltonian (`hCore`),
# a (not necessarily orthogonal) set of orbitals with known overlap integrals (`overlap`),
# and a sparse 4-tensor of electron-electron repulsion terms (`eeRep`). It also of course
# uses `n`, the number of orbitals, and `nOcc`, the number of occupied orbitals.
#
# Passing -1 for nOcc will allow a variable occupation number, i.e. Grand canonical
#
# Optional arguments start with the number of electrons per orbital ('orbitalsize') --
# for Restricted Hartree-Fock this should be 2, but for generalized Hartree-Fock this
# should be 1. Next is a constant offset in energy (`enuc`) that represents
# non-electron terms in the Hamiltonian, and a tolerance (`tol`) at which the energy
# needs to stabilize. The `spinSymm` parameter will enforce that the Fock matrix is
# symmetric under spin inversion, to fix spin contamination issues.
#
# It returns (energy, orbitals, densityMat, energy_levels). `orbitals` are sorted by energy, and
# include all orbitals, not just the occupied ones. For instance, `orbitals[:,1]` is
# the lowest-energy orbital. `energy_levels` is the computed Fock energies for all orbitals.
